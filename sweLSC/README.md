Application for OCR Scanning

About

This application was made in a College Software Engineering course.  It's purpose is to allow a student scan their syllabus and be able to pull out important information:  professor name, phone number, e-mail.  You can then add this information into your contacts list so you can easily find it later when you need to get in touch with a professor.  You also have the option to manually add a calendar event  if you so wish to. 
 
If you need any help getting it setup, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me at tguichinone@gmail.com :)
